# HaffumanCode

According to build a haffman tree, we can get haffman code, which is optimal code. However, there are many kinds of optimal code, and haffman code is just one of them. <br>
This project is dedicated to find an effective solution to point out whether a given code is haffman code, or it's just an optimal code.
<br>
You can see P4.key to get our idea.
